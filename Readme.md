# ARP Spoofing Detection and Mitigation in SDN Environments

## Overview
This project establishes a comprehensive framework for detecting and mitigating ARP spoofing attacks within Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments. By integrating Mininet for network emulation and Ettercap for ARP manipulation, the framework provides a proactive defense strategy to safeguard against ARP spoofing.

## Project Description
The project involves setting up a Mininet-based virtual network environment that includes multiple hosts, a switch, and a Ryu controller. This simulated network enables the testing and evaluation of ARP spoofing detection and mitigation mechanisms. The setup allows for monitoring ARP traffic, identifying malicious activities, and applying real-time countermeasures to maintain network security.

### Key Features
- **Network Emulation with Mininet:** Constructed a virtual network topology with four hosts, one switch, and a Ryu controller to simulate realistic network scenarios.
- **ARP Manipulation with Ettercap:** Employed Ettercap to simulate ARP spoofing attacks, enabling the testing of detection and mitigation strategies.
- **Real-time Monitoring with Ryu Controller:** Developed and deployed Ryu controller applications to analyze ARP packets, detect discrepancies, and block malicious ARP responses in real time.

## Tools Used
- **Mininet:** Provides network emulation capabilities to create and test virtual network topologies.
- **Ryu Controller:** An SDN framework used for managing network flows and implementing custom network policies.
- **Ettercap:** A network security tool utilized for generating ARP spoofing attacks and analyzing their impact.
- **Python:** Used for scripting and implementing Ryu controller applications to handle network traffic and security tasks.

## Implementation Details
1. **Mininet Topology Setup:** Designed and configured a network topology with four hosts, a single switch, and a Ryu controller to emulate a real-world network environment.
2. **Event Handling in Ryu:** Leveraged the event-driven architecture of the Ryu controller to process OpenFlow messages, handle ARP packets, and execute detection algorithms.
3. **ARP Packet Analysis:** Extracted and analyzed ARP protocol data from Ethernet frames to detect anomalies and potential spoofing attempts.
4. **Detection and Mitigation:** Maintained an IP-to-MAC address mapping table, detected inconsistencies indicative of ARP spoofing, and implemented mitigation measures by dropping malicious ARP packets.

## Achievements
- Successfully implemented a real-time ARP spoofing detection and mitigation framework.
- Enhanced network security by ensuring accurate IP-to-MAC address mappings and preventing unauthorized access.
- Demonstrated effective defensive strategies against ARP spoofing attacks in a controlled, virtualized network environment, showcasing the viability of the solution for practical applications.

## Future Directions
- **AI Integration:** Exploring the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to further improve detection accuracy and adapt to evolving spoofing methods.
- **Scalability Testing:** Conducting scalability tests to evaluate the frameworkâ€™s performance in larger, more complex SDN deployments.
